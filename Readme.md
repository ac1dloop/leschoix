# LesChoix

Simple one-header class to parse command line options for your program

LesChoix is part of my Y namespace classes where **Y** stands 'for why the f*ck did you invent bycicle?'

### Why?

The main point is to have something to include fast in project and use as is for testing purposes.
**LesChoix** Lacks of any type checking and not optimized at all

**It is simple and it parses** !

### Docs

to make docs you have to have doxygen installed

```shell
doxygen doxyconf
```
I dont think they really needed

### Example

Example is in example directory
